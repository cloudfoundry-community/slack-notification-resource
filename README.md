Slack notification sending resource
===================================

Sends messages to [Slack](https://slack.com).

Resource Type Configuration
---------------------------

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: slack-notification
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: cfcommunity/slack-notification-resource
    tag: latest
```

Source Configuration
--------------------

To setup an [Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) go to https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/.

-	`url`: *Required.* The webhook URL as provided by Slack. Usually in the form: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX`

```yaml
resources:
- name: slack-alert
  type: slack-notification
  source:
    url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX
```

Behavior
--------

### `out`: Sends message to Slack.

Send message to Slack, with the configured parameters.

#### Parameters

Required:

One or more of the following:
-	`text`: Static text of the message to send.
-	`text_file`: File that contains the message to send. This allows the message to be generated by a previous task step in the Concourse job.

If you ommit the `text` parameter, the content of the file specified in the
`text_file` parameter will be used verbatim.  Alternatively, you can include
the environment variable `$TEXT_FILE_CONTENT` in the `text` string to include
the content of the file with other static text and interpolated variables (see
Metadata section below)

If you use `text` without using the `$TEXT_FILE_CONTENT` in it, the content
will not be added to your message.

The text and text_file content can contain multiple lines, emojis like :simple_smile:,
and links in form `<http://example.com>` or `<http://example.com|Click here!>`.

Under the philosophy that its better to write something than fail silently,
the following will be sent under these conditions:

- when `text` is omitted, and...
  - `text_file` omitted, or present but file missing:
    > *(no notification given)*
  - `text_file` specified and present but file empty:
    > *(missing notification text)*
- when `text` is present, but evaluates to empty string after variable interpolation:
  > *(missing notification text)*
- when `text` specified with `$TEXT_FILE_CONTENT` and more content, and...
  - `text_file` omitted, or present but file missing
    * `$TEXT_FILE_CONTENT` is replaced with "*(no notification given)*"
  - `text_file` specified and present but file empty:
    * `$TEXT_FILE_CONTENT` is replaced with empty string.

Optional:

-	`channel`: *Optional.* Override channel to send message to. `#channel` and `@user` forms are allowed.
-	`username`: *Optional.* Override name of the sender of the message.
-	`icon_url`: *Optional.* Override icon by providing URL to the image.
-	`icon_emoji`: *Optional.* Override icon by providing emoji code (e.g. `:ghost:`).
- `silent`: *Optional.* Do not print curl output (avoids leaking slack webhook URL)
- `always_notify`: *Optional.* Attempt to notify even if there are errors or missing text. (Expects true or false, defaults to false)

Explore formatting with Slack's [Message Builder](https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting/builder).

#### Metadata

Various metadata is available in the form of environment variables. Any environment variables present in the parameters will be automatically evaluated; this enables dynamic parameter content.

The following pipeline config snippet demonstrates how to incorporate the metadata:

```yaml
---
jobs:
- name: some-job
  plan:
  - put: slack-alert
    params:
      channel: '#my_channel'
      text_file: results/message.txt
      text: |
        The build had a result. Check it out at:
        http://my.concourse.url/pipelines/$BUILD_PIPELINE_NAME/jobs/$BUILD_JOB_NAME/builds/$BUILD_NAME
        or at:
        http://my.concourse.url/builds/$BUILD_ID

        Result: $TEXT_FILE_CONTENT
```

See the [official documentation](http://concourse.ci/implementing-resources.html#resource-metadata) for a complete list of available metadata.

Examples
--------

If you're interested in the API of Concourse resources and/or contributing to this resource, you can play with the `out` script using examples. There are some available in the `test` folder.

Note: they have a `params.debug` set so that it only prints out the data structures rather than attempting to invoke the Slack API. Remove it and set a real Slack API to test the script against Slack.
